### Hi, I am Austin

Probably working on icons or something related to icons. If you're ever in Chicago feel free to reach out for tea 🍵 / beer 🍺.

Co-run [Pictogrammers](https://pictogrammers.com) with some amazing designers and developers.

#### Topics I Enjoy

- ✒ Icons (obviously)
- 🧩 Web Components
- 📃 TypeScript
- 📄 Documentation
- 🤔 Unit Testing!

Contact me on Twitter [@templarian](https://templarian.com). Unless it's about something I maintain, then maybe create an issue 😉.
